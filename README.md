# Benford's law. Fraud Research Dataviz
Dataviz project to investigate 3 companies. A decision will need to be made so the IRS should build a legal case to investigate the institution for fraud.

## Background

We have recently been hired by the US internal revenue service (IRS) to catch corporate cheaters. We have been given three companies to investigate. We will need to decide if the IRS should build a legal case to investigate the institution for fraud.
    <ul>
        <li>Sino Forest Corporation: You have the values from the financial statement numbers of Sino Forest Corporation's 2010 Report.</li>
        <li>Government Entity: A dataset containing the card transactions for a government entity 2010.</li>
        <li>General Motors: The amounts paid to vendors for the 90 days preceding General Motor's 2009 liquidation.</li>
    </ul>  
    
    
## The Challenge

We will be responsible to report as much evidence as we can with the data provided for each institution above. The government entity has more available data than the other two which will require us to dig deeper to find additional clues. <br>

Sources will be available at the 'sources/' folder. We can use more than one of the data sets provided but we are not expected to use them all.
